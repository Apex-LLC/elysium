    <h4 class="text-muted font-weight-bold">What the Beta Process Will Look Like</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>We will create an ELLY account for you using the email address you provide</li>
      <li>The ELLY data collection module will be installed at your site</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The module is a small windows service that allows ELLY to read the utility data from your BAS</li>
        <li class="font-italic">Currently available for <strong>Johnson Controls Metasys</strong> as well as <strong>Niagara</strong> systems</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Once trend data is available (within a few hours), we will work with you to assign meters to tenants</li>
      <li>Your tenants will receive email invitations to finish creating their ELLY accounts</li>
      <li>You will configure your bank account information and due dates so you can receive utility payments</li>
      <li>At the end of the billing cycle, your tenants' invoices will be automatically generated, and a payment reminder sent to their email</li>
      <li>Your tenants will pay their invoices through ELLY, and the funds will be automatically deposited into your linked bank account within 1 business day</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h5 class="">and that's it!</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>After this easy, one-time set up, ELLY will continue to run in the background for seamless, automatic tenant billing.</h5>
